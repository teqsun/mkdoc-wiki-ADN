# Lexie - The codification of reinvented verbatims

In the wake of **harmony**, **slidie** and **quizie**, the DNA continuation is enriched by a new tool designed to solve a very concrete problem: the hell of **post -coding in Excel**.The study managers, freelancers or trainees spend hours copying cod plans, checking fragile formulas and re -importing files in their statistical software.**Lexie** was designed to simplify the process and optimize the work: _Faire the job, quickly and well_, without unnecessary complexity, and at an accessible cost.

## A direct response to the limits of Excel
Excel is universal, but static coding quickly becomes an obstacle when it comes to code thousands of verbatims: difficult to reorganize a coded plan along the way, easy to break a correspondence, impossible to have quality control in real time.**LEXIE transforms this linear task into a living process**: a codes plan that is reorganized by dragging, a display clarity which drastically limits errors, the assignment by lots, progression statistics visible at all times.

---

## Sovereignty and technical flexibility
Many competing solutions require **all SaaS**.Lexie takes the opposite side: **100% on -prime**, so no data that leaves the client's infrastructure.The application works completely offline for manual coding.**Artificial intelligence is "branched"**: The administrator adds his own OPENAI, Azure AI or Mistral key and decides where the data transit.

This approach _bringing Your Own Key_ ("Byok") is doubly virtuous: the customer **masters his tokenization costs** and remains **fully in accordance with the RGPD**, since the verbatims are never stored by a third party.

## A direct bridge with harmony
For users of **harmony**, Lexie is not "one more tool": it is **a native step** of the treatment flow.The coded variables appear instantly in Harmonie studies, and the user can immediately produce cross -taps, weighted and filtered.No more complex and risky import stages;The treatment chain is considerably fluidified.

## FUNCTIONS that really count
*** Open and lively coded plan**: Import from Excel, creation _in vivo_ directly since reading verbatims, automatic themes suggestions when AI is activated, possibility of grouping / modifying / reassiving during codification in a dynamic and controlled manner.
*** Deterministic re -application**: After human validation, Lexie applies exact rules.No surprises, no need for unnecessary proofreading.
*** Embedded statistics**: Number of coded verbatims, progression on the clusters to be treated, fast sorting to check the quotas or and the relevance of the codification.
*** Multiple exports**: Excel detailed for external partners, native variables for harmony or easily modifiable complete codification file.
*** 'Poweruser'**: Like Harmonie, Lexie has a batch control language and the possibility of Python scripts to optimize repetitive pipelines.

## Market positioning and economical model
The European market is swarming with IA - **ascriber**, **codeit**, **Caplena**, **canvs ai**
   - which promise to code "effortlessly" but at often dissuasive rates for light structures: subscriptions of several hundred euros per month, data stored in the United States, black boxes difficult to audit.

**Lexie chooses a different route**: _Faire pay just what creates value_.

* **Starter – 39 € par mois et par poste** : tout le cœur fonctionnel en manuel, parfait pour remplacer Excel dans un petit institut ou un cabinet freelance.
* **Pro – 79 € par mois** : suggestions IA activables, coût de l’IA payé directement au fournisseur par la clé du client (aucune marge cachée).
* **Enterprise – 5 000 € par an** : licence serveur illimitée, SSO, scripting avancé, support prioritaire.

For punctual projects, a model _pay - per -verbatim_ allows you to invoice the volume without subscription.The objective is clear: **democratize professional codification** with all those who had only the Excel alternative or expensive providers.

## A philosophy of transparency
The adoption of AI in research should not mean the abandonment of human control.Lexie has been thought of so that **AI accompanies the work of humans**: the semantic suggestions are both verifiable and.The user can validate, adjust or refuse.No automatic classification is irreversible._L’ia assists, the human decides._

## Recommandations de communication

The strength of Lexie's marketing discourse is based on a balance between three major messages - accessibility, sovereignty and DNA synergy - and on the ability to lift, objections that competitors only deal with in appendix.Here is the guideline:

1. Argument Excel‑killer, ancré dans la preuve chiffrée. Le gain ‑70 % d’erreurs / +40 % de productivité est à placer dans chaque pitch ; c’est l’élément qui parle le plus aux utilisateurs qui vivent encore dans Excel. Tout visuel (vidéo 30 s ou capture avant/après) doit l’illustrer.

2. Underline sovereignty: on -prime + byok IA ("Bring your Own Key").While American SaaS platforms skate on the GDPR, Lexie highlights the data that never leaves the customer.The Bring Your Own Key approach reassures the CIOs: no black box, no additional cost hidden token.Place a “Data Stays Home” seal on each support.

3. Insist on the ultra -BAS input price, without devaluing the tool.The Starter Formula € 39 per month must be readable immediately;It makes the promise of Excel - Killer credible.To avoid the "cheap" effect, show the pro -range pro and enterprise from the second slide.

4. Lock the existing park with the harmony synergy.The argument "0 import, 0 export" could be huge: if you have harmony, choosing a third -party solution is a non -sens.This sentence must come back as it is in the arguments.

5. Position power power like a bonus, never as a constraint.The Python scripts and the CLI reassure the technical teams of institute without frightening the non -tech audience.Storytelling: “You can do everything in No -Code;If you are a geek, the door is open ”.

6. Treat the Offline/AI Cloud tension from the start.A FAQ or a visual insert must explain: “Lexie works 100% offline by default;Connect the AI ​​when you decide. "This defuses the potential confusion on the promise on a print.

7. Convert social evidence as soon as possible.Even anonymized, pilot feedback (annual barometer coded 40% faster, 95% user satisfaction) consolidate the promise "does the job very well".

In summary, the proposed narration is: "Go from Excel to the Insight in 30 minutes, at home, for the price of a coffee per day - and if you have harmony, everything is already trendy.»»

## Conclusion
By combining a **floor price**, a **local installation** and a **ia under control**, Lexie responds to a niche neglected by the cloud solutions: that of professionals who want the quality of a large institute without the price or complexity.Added to the DNA suite, it completes the study chain: **collect, code, analyze and restore**
   - faster, more surely and at controlled cost.Lexie is not a gadget: it is **the new basic tool** for anyone who deals with open questions.
