* Prices:* Forsta works on business license (tailor -made pricing depending on the volume of data and modules chosen).Often, these are global annual contracts including the investigation platform and the analytical module.

- **Other notable solutions:**
- **NVIVO, ATLAS.TI, MAXQDA:** Software of **Academic qualitative**, making it possible to manually code verbatims and do lexical research.Less adapted to large quantitative volumes (no automation has pushed by default).For example, Nvivo offers a * preliminary self -coding * by themes via IA, but this remains summary and oriented exploratory research ([Nvivo: Qualitative Leading Data Analysis Software -Lumivero] (https://lumivero.com/products/nvivo/#:~:Text=nvivo%3a%20leading%20qualitative%20data%20Analysis,them%20in%20broad%20topic%20areas)).
- **Provalis Research (Wordstat, QDA Miner):** Tools combining statistics and qualitative codification, sometimes used in studies (especially North America).They allow **post -coding** of open questions with dictionaries or AI, while leaving total control to the study manager ([Coding and analysis of open questions - ProvalisResearch] (https://provalisresearch.com/fr/solutions-2/applications/analyse-des-questions-ouvertes/#:Text=coding%20et%20analyse%20des%20quesions,d%C3%A9pend%20d%27une%20vari%C3%A9t%Ac3%A9%A9%A9%A
-**Open-Source / API tools:** Some data teams use NLP APIs directly (ex: **aws understand**, **Google Cloud NL, Azure Language** ([12 Best Ai-Powered Text Software Tools in2025] (https://www.displayr.com/11-best-text-analysis-software-in-in-2025/#:~:Text=categorize%20text%20easily%20in%20displayr)) ([12 Best Ai-Poweed Text Software Tools2025] (https://www.displayr.com/11-best-ai-text-analysis-software-in-2025/#:~:Text=azure%20ai%20language)) to build tailor-made analyzes.These solutions offer **scalability** and **Technical flexibility**, but require programming skills (no ready -to -use guy).
- **Semantic ia startups (France):***Q ° Emotion*(Analysis of emotions and irritants customers) is a French SaaS who categorizes verbatims in feelings /emotions in an automated manner ([q ° emotion (@qemotionapp) /X] (https://x.com/qemotionapp?lang=en#:~:Text=q%C2%B0emotion%20.rep%C3%A9rez%20et%20diminuz%20les)).* SEMDEE* or* PROXEM* also proposed company text mining platforms (analysis of consumption, CRM, etc.).These local tools highlight an adaptation to the specificities of French language and advice support, but are often sold as global solutions of text analytics more than just codification tools.

## Prestataires de codification manuelle ou semi-automatique

In parallel with software, **many companies and freelancers** offer **codification services** of verbatims, generally manually (possibly with internal tools).These providers are often used by institutes to **outsource** the post-coding of open questionnaires, especially when the volumes are very important or multilingual.

- **Specialized coding office:** Companies like*Focus Forward*(USA),*Codingexperts*(USA),*Gazelle Global*(USA) or*BJD*(USA) have been specialized for a long time in the manual coding of verbatims ([Top Market Research Coding Services & Software in2025] (https://blix.ai/blog/market-research-coding-services#:~:Text=,volume%20manual%20Coding%20and%20Analysis)) ([Top Market Research Coding Services & Software in2025] (https://blix.ai/blog/market-research-coding-services#:~:Text=,uk%29%3a%20focusers%20on%20verbatim)).They have **experienced coder teams**, sometimes distributed worldwide to cover many **languages ​​** and time zones.Their value proposal:** Quality **(coding by humans trained to detect nuances),** flexibility **(transcription services, translation in addition to coding), but this implies a higher time and cost than an automatic solution.For example,*nuance*(USA) is renowned for managing** massive volumes **with coders with an average of 11 years of experience ([Verbatim Coding Services | nuance] (https://www.nuancecoding.com/services/verbatim/#:Text=building%20a%20list%20called%20a,assiging%20it%20a%20numeric%20code)) ([Verbatim Coding Services |] (https://www.nuancecoding.com/services/verbatim/#:~:text=costs%20and%20timing%20depend%20on,contact%20us%20for%20an%20estimate).These companies generally invoice** per unit **(by coded response) or to** time spent **, with different scales depending on the complexity of the codeframe, languages, etc.(Costs are often** on quote ** After estimation of volume and language ([Verbatim Coding Services | nuance] (https://www.nuancecoding.com/services/verbatim/#:~:text=))).

- **Multilingual agencies in Europe:** In the United Kingdom, we find for example*The Language Factory*(UK) or*Language Insight*(UK) which combine translation and codification, useful for international projects ([Top Market Research Coding Services & Software in2025] (https://blix.ai/blog/market-research-coding-services#:~:Text=,specific%20manual%20Coding%20solutions)).In Germany, * Tema-q * also offers this type of service.These European providers highlight **linguistic precision** and local cultural knowledge to faithfully code foreign verbatims.The prices can be a little higher than offshore offers, but with linguistic quality insurance.

- **bpo and offshore:** Outsourcing companies such as*flatworld solutions*(India) or*outsource2india*offer coding services at lower cost, mobilizing large teams in Asia ([Outsource Verbatim Coding Services - FlatworldSolutions] (https://www.flatworldsolutions.com/research-enalysis/verbatim-coding-services.php#:~:Text=solutions%20www,Of%20words%2C%20phrases%2C%20voices%2C) ([Top Market Research Coding Services & Software2025] (https://blix.ai/blog/market-research-coding-services#:~:Text=,specializes%20in%20research%20support%20services)).The **Unit cost** is competitive, which is suitable for huge volumes, but that requires a very good transmission of the coding notebook (risk of **cultural lag** or **round trip** if blurred instructions ([Top Market Research Coding Services & Software in2025] (https://blix.ai/blog/market-research-coding-services#:~:Text=,,context%20switching)) ([Top Market Research Coding Services & Software in2025] (https://blix.ai/blog/market-research-coding-services#:~:Text=outsourced%20Coding%20Teams%20Typically%20lack,respons%20are%20interpred%20and%20Categorized)).

- **Freelances & platforms:** For smaller projects, some institutes or companies use **freelancers** (via Fiverr, Upwork, Malt, etc.).It is a flexible and **economical option for small volumes** ([Top Market Research Coding Services & Software in2025] (https://blix.ai/blog/market-research-coding-services#:~:Text=research%20Company%20with%20qualitative%20and,independent%20Coders%20for%20Smaller%20Projects)) but the quality depends strongly on the recruited individual andFreelance.

**Positioning of these services:** In general, the **manual coding outsourced** brings the finesse and the assurance that a human eye passes on each response, useful for studies where **precision prevails on speed** (eg codification of complex medical verbatims, or ad hoc studies of low volume but highly strategic).However, it has notable drawbacks: longer deadlines, increasing cost with volume, risk of **human errors** or inconsistencies if the training is insufficient ([Top Market Research Coding Services & Software in 2025] (https://blix.ai/blog/market-research-coding-services#:~Market Research Coding Services & Software in 2025] (https://blix.ai/blog/market-research-coding-services#:~:Text=,error%20and%20bias)).In addition, if the customer wishes to modify the coded grid along the way, it is often necessary *to recode from the start *, generating costly rework ([Top Market Research Coding Services & Software in 2025] (https://blix.ai/blog/market-research-coding-services#:~:Text=, Aany%20changes)).

➡️ **Market trend:** Number of players now offer approaches **Hybrids**, combining automation and human validation.For example, some traditional coding providers incorporate AI tools to pre-tackle verbatims and only manually validate questionable cases.For their part, tools like Lexie, Caplena or Codeit allow users to **adjust manually** Automatic categorizations - bringing together the best of both worlds (speed of IA + human judgment).

## Conclusion - Differentiation of **Lexie** on this market

All of these solutions shows a movement towards **more AI** and productivity in the treatment of open questions.To position **lexie** Commercially, it is necessary to identify its **USP (unique selling proposals)** compared to these competitors.For example :

- **Specialization vs.Versatility:** Some tools (Ascriber, Codeit, Lexie ...) focus on **Coding of verbatims of investigations** When other wider platforms target all types of feedback (Caplena, Chattermill, etc.).If Lexie is hyper-specialized “Market Studies”, this can be an asset of * focus * (better understanding of the needs of institutes, interface designed for post-codifiers, etc.), or on the contrary a limit in the face of versatile tools used continuously by customers.It will therefore be necessary to communicate either on **Sectoral specialization** (if this is the case with lexie), or on **flexibility of use** of lexie in various cases (so comparable to generalist platforms).

- **Ergonomics and simplicity:** One of the key criteria of choice is **User experience**.Lexie will have to differentiate itself by a simple, “sufficient” and pleasant interface, especially if potential customers find certain existing or complex existing solutions.For example, **If Lexie offers a 100% No-Code experience, in French, with a rapid handling**, this can seduce non-technical European actors, compared to Anglo-Saxon solutions sometimes perceived as more technical.The anecdote of * "the sufficient tool" * designed by Alexis Favreau goes in this direction, suggesting an effective minimalist approach to the user.

- **Intelligent automation:** Most competitors incorporate AI, but differ in the manner: Lexie will have to clarify its approach (**generative, model internal on studies data, etc.**).If lexie allows as Blix de **all auto-coder then to edit**, or as code to choose the degree of AI, it is an argument to be highlighted to reassure the quality (**"to combine the speed of AI and human judgment"**).Any unique functionality (eg irony detection, specific emotional categorization, etc.) can be a differentiation factor.

- **Adapted economic model:** Finally, **Lexie pricing** must correspond to the targeted market.Large accounts accept high subscriptions, while smaller structures are looking for **use or affordable options**.If Lexie offers, for example, an **act** (by investigation or by batch of verbatims) or a **freemium** of testing, this can distinguish it.According to the benchmarks, an entry point around a few hundred euros per month for an average volume seems a standard (Caplena at € 99/month to start ([Caplena Pricing, Alternatives & More 2025 | capture] (https://www.capterra.com/p/231130/capplen~ 25K $/year on 25k verbatims ([flexible plans and pricing for ai feedback analytics | thematic] (https://getthematic.com/product/plan-and-pring#Lexie can choose to be a competitive ** on prices to penetrate the market (e.g. more transparent or decreasing rates without long binding).

In summary, Lexie evolves in a rich ecosystem ranging from the **Giants established** to the **innovative startups**.To position itself, Lexie must capitalize on its own strengths - whether it is a **best experience in French**, a more efficient or explainable **IA**, a **customer service or support** superior, or a **flexible offer**
   - and clearly communicate how it better meets the needs of user of verbatims codification solutions.Continuous monitoring of the evolutions of these competitors will also be essential, because the field of semantic analysis is constantly increasing (eg new models of AI, multiplatform integrations, etc.).By standing out on **added** criteria ** and by sending the points of pain (cost, time, complexity) identified among competitors, Lexie will be able to refine its commercial positioning and its unique speech on the market.
