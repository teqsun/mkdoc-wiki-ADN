# Na2val

## NA2VAL OR NATOVAL function

The ** Na2val ** function applies to digital, literal and temporal variables. & Nbsp;

It has the effect of creating a variable in which the homeless of the original variable are reassigned to a particular value.

The variable obtained therefore no longer has no response.

### Syntax: & nbsp;

Q01.NA2val (Value)

Or

\ _NA2val (Q01; Value)

& nbsp;

|& nbsp;|** Name ** |** Type ** |** Description ** |** Note ** |
|--- |--- |--- |--- |--- |
|& nbsp;|Value |Number |Value assigned to homelessness |Compulsory |


#### Remarks :

For a more advanced response re-affect, use the Fix function.

#### Examples:

AGE.NA2VAL (45)

Created a variable in which the homeless have recovered the value 45. There is no more self-reply.
