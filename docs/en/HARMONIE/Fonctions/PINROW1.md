# Pinrow

## Pinrow function

The **Pinrow** function modifies the behavior of certain items of the line dimension of a variable during hierarchicals.

A pinned modality is not concerned by the tris/hierarchies: it remains fixed in its place.

This is very often the case for example of "other", "none" items, etc.
