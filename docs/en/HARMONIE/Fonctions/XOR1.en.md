# Xor

## XOR function

The ** Xor ** function applies an "or exclusive" logic of modality by following the principle of harmonization of the methods.The arguments correspond to the different variables or constructions to be combined.

### Syntax: & nbsp;

\ _Xor (selection)

& nbsp;

|& nbsp;|** Name ** |** Type ** |** Description ** |** Note ** |
|--- |--- |--- |--- |--- |
|& nbsp;|Selection |Selection of variables |Expression of selection of variables (ex: '$ "s?"') Or list of variables separated by a ";"; "|Compulsory |


#### Remarks :

A 'XOR' between two variables therefore does not produce a universe \!To create a universe, use Xorflt \!

#### Examples:

\ _XOR (S1; S3)

Or

S1 XOR S3

Or

S1 \^S3

The result contains as many modalities as necessary for the methods to be harmonized.For each respondent, a modality is cited when it is cited in one and a single argument.
