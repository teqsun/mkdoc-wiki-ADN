# Recap

## Recap Function

The setpoint **Recap** allows you to easily create a summary table based on an items battery (or items grid).

Unlike Sumup, this function does not change the variable, but is content to indicate to the ventilation engine what are the methods to hide.

& nbsp;

Disadvantage: it is not possible to exploit the result variable in another recodification

Advantage: the method also works when the basics of details vary

### Syntax: & nbsp;

Q01.Recap (selection)

Or

\ _Recap (Q01; selection)

& nbsp;

|& nbsp;|**Name** |**Type** |**Description** |**Note** |

The recap function keeps the universe of the source variable.

The recap function does not modify the base of the variable used.
