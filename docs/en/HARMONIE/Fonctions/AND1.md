# And

## Function and

Not to be confused with the Operator and which Calculates Ã  Based on and Logical Between the respondents of the arguments.

The **and** Function Applied A "and Logical" of Modality by not following the Principle of Harmonization of the Methods.the Arguments corresponds to the different variables or logical constructions to be combined.

### Syntax: & nbsp;

\ _And (selection)

& nbsp;

| & nbsp; | **name** | **type** | **Description** | **Note** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| & nbsp; | selection | selection of variables | Expression of selection of variables (ex: '$ "s?"') or list of variables separated by a ";"; ";"| Compulsory |

#### NOIKS:

The Number of Methods of the Variables in Argument must be compatible.

The First Selected Variable and that with the Large Number of Modality.

### EXAMPLES:

\ _AND (S1A; S1B)

The result is a logical variable with the same modalities (in number and in labels) as the first selected variable.

The Variables With Fewer Modalities Than The First Are Supplemeted With Empty Methods.

For Each Breature, A Modality is cited when it is cited in all the arguments.

IMPORTANT: AN 'AND' BETWEEN Two Variables therefore do not produce a universe \! To Create a Universe, Use univ or andflt \!
