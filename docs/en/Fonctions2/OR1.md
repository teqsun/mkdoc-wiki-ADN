# Gold

## Function or

.

The **or** Function Applied A Modality "or Logic" by following the Principle of Harmonization of the Methods.The Arguments corresponds to the different variable or constructions to be combined.

& nbsp;

IMPORTANT: A 'Gold' Between Two Variables Therefore Dues Not Produce A Universe \! To Create A Universe, Use Univ or andflt \!

### Syntax:

\ _Or (selection)

& nbsp;

| & nbsp; | **name** | **type** | **Description** | **Note** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| & nbsp; | selection | selection of variables | Expression of selection of variables (ex: '$ "s?"') or list of variables separated by a ";"; ";"| Compulsory |

### EXAMPLES:

\ _Or (S1; S3)

Gold

S1 or S3

Gold

S1 \ | S3

& nbsp;

The Result Contains as Many Modalities as necessary for the method to be harmonized.for each breathe, a modality is cited when it is cited in at least one argument.

& nbsp;

Be careful, not to be confused with the operator 째 (or logic without harmonization of the method)

& nbsp;

Thus, s1 째 S3 gives a variable with the same methods as the right argument of 째, here s3.

It is possible to write: S1.Selmod (1) 째 S3, in this case the modality of the left argument is applied to the terms of the right argument.

If the Operator is used on dimensioned Variables, the Principle of Harmonization of the Methods is Always Applied to Lines/Columns.
